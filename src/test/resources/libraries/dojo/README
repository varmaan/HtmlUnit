This directory contains the resources necessary to run the Dojo JavaScript library unit tests.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific version of the Dojo library. Each of these subdirectories
was created by checking out a tagged version of the Dojo source tree from SVN and copying the "dojo"
and "util/doh" directories.
