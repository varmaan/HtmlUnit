This directory contains the resources necessary to run the Google Web Toolkit tests.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific version of GWT. Each of these subdirectories
was created by downloading the distribution and copying the 'war' of sample directories.

gwt-servlet.jar is added at parent directory to be reused by different samples.
