		<faq id="HowToReportABug">
			<question>
				I've found a bug, how do I report it?
			</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					The best way is to open a bug report in the
					<a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=47038&amp;atid=448266">sourceforge bug
					tracking database</a>.  Sending a bug report to the mailing list runs the risk that the
					bug may get lost. Putting it in the bug database guarantees that it won't. Please
					search the bug database to see if your bug hasn't already been reported before opening
					a new one.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you know how to fix the problem then patches are gratefully accepted.

		<faq id="AJAXDoesNotWork">
			<question>
				Nothing happens when using HtmlUnit with AJAX, although page works correctly in browsers. What's wrong?
			</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					The main thread using HtmlUnit may be finishing execution before allowing background threads to run.
					You have a couple of options:
					<ol>
						<li><code>webClient.setAjaxController(new NicelyResynchronizingAjaxController());</code> will tell your WebClient instance to re-synchronize asynchronous XHR.</li>
						<li><code>webClient.waitForBackgroundJavaScript(10000);</code> or <code>webClient.waitForBackgroundJavaScriptStartingBefore(10000);</code> just after getting the page and before manipulating it.</li>
						<li>Explicitly wait for a condition that is expected be fulfilled when your JavaScript runs, e.g.
            <source><![CDATA[

        //try 20 times to wait .5 second each for filling the page.
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            if (condition_to_happen_after_js_execution) {
                break;
            }
            synchronized (page) {
                page.wait(500);
            }
        }
            ]]></source>
						</li>
					</ol>

		<faq id="HowToModifyRequestOrResponse">
			<question>
				How to modify the outgoing request or incoming response?
			</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					You can subclass HttpWebConnection and override getResponse() as:
            <source><![CDATA[

        new WebConnectionWrapper(webClient) {

            public WebResponse getResponse(WebRequestSettings settings) throws IOException {
                // modify the request settings
                WebResponseImpl response = (WebResponseImpl) super.getResponse(settings);
                // modify the response
                return response;
            }
        };
            ]]></source>

		<faq id="CookieSupport">
			<question>
				I'm having problems with cookie support.
			</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					HtmlUnit relies on <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html">commons-httpclient 3.1</a> for Cookie handling. 
					The odds are pretty good that whatever cookie problems you're encountering already have a solution as explained in the <a href="http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/cookies.html">Cookie Guide</a>.
					If that doesn't help then post something to the HtmlUnit mailing list.

		<faq id="RedirectionDiagnosticMessages">
			<question>
				I get error messages about redirection being disabled but I've turned it on.
			</question>
			<answer>
				<source>
26.02.2003 16:07:05 org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase   processRedirectResponse
INFO: Redirect requested but followRedirects is disabled
				</source>
				<p>
					It's an annoyance that I haven't figured out how to fix yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					For a variety of reasons, I handle the redirection logic inside HtmlUnit rather than letting
					commons-httpclient handle it for me. It's commons-httpclient that is displaying that message
					because I have explicitly disabled its redirection support.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'd like to filter out that warning message but haven't figured out a clean way of doing it.  A
					number of people have pointed out that it's easy to disable a message if you know which logger
					is being used.  The problem is that there isn't a way to disable the messages without knowing
					the logger in use.

		<faq id="Roadmap">
			<question>
				What version will feature X be in?
			</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					There is no "roadmap" of releases.  Features will be added as 
					they are written.
				</p>
				<p>
					Changes to the product (including new features) are implemented by 
					volunteers in their spare time.  If feature X is important to you 
					and nobody seems to be working on it then perhaps you should consider 
					writing it yourself and <a href="submittingPatches.html">submitting a 
					patch</a>.
				</p>

		</faq>

		<faq id="SVNRights">
			<question>
				How do I get commit rights for the SVN repository?
			</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					Submit a bunch of patches that improve the product and when the
					existing committers are satisfied with your work, you will be given
					commit access.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a rule of thumb, if your patches need to be "touched up" before
					they can be committed, then you won't be getting commit access.  Refer
					to the page on <a href="submittingPatches.html">submitting patches</a>
					for an idea of what is expected.

		<faq id="MemoryLeak">
			<question>
				HtmlUnit appears to be leaking memory; what's the deal?
			</question>
			<answer>
				<p>
					Make sure (a) that you are using the latest version of HtmlUnit, and
					(b) that you are calling WebClient.closeAllWindows() when you are
					finished with your WebClient instance.
