This directory contains the resources necessary to run the jQuery JavaScript library unit tests.

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific version of the jQuery library. Each of these subdirectories
was created by checking out SVN source, building the release with ant, and copying the
src, dist and test directories.

"Expected" files are generated by 'copying all' the text of the corresponding browser and remove the header and footer.
